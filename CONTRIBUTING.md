# Process for submitting work to this project

* Git clone this repo.
* Make a branch and work on that branch.
* Feel free to try and implement new matchers, improve doubles, refactor code, or improve coverage.
* test whether your changes work in your local environment: run `pip install -e .`
* When the feature is complete and the tests are passing, make a pull request.
* You must get 2 devs approval before the code can be merged.
  * The expectation is you give an approval if you understand how the code works and think it's of good quality
  * Try to use a PR as a knowledge-sharing ground
    - Write an informative description of what the PR changes.
    - Discuss bits of code on the PR before approving.
* Once code is merged into master, and everything works, we will update the PyPi version.
